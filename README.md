## Description

This React app is an example of how to fetch WordPress posts and render them with <a href="https://vanillaframework.io/docs">Vanilla Framework<a> by Canonical.

<a href="https://vanillaframework.io/docs/patterns/card">Card component<a> is used to render the posts. Card header text is dynamically generated depending on whenter the post is assigned with any group, topic, tag or category. Additionally, a link to the corresponding group, topic, tag or category is generated as well, so the header title is clickable :)

Other elements (article picture and the main title) lead to the article itself.
